# Exercise: Hello Compact

## Goal

Create the minimal valid Compact program that compiles successfully.

## Instructions

1. Open `exercise.compact`
2. Add the required pragma statement
3. Add the standard library import
4. The file should compile with no errors

## Requirements

- Pragma version: `>= 0.16 && <= 0.18`
- Import the standard library

## Verify

compact compile exercise.compact
```

A successful compilation means you did it right!
