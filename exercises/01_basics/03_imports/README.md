# Exercise: Imports

## Goal

Learn about importing modules in Compact.

## Instructions

1. Open `exercise.compact`
2. The pragma is already written
3. Add the import statement for the standard library
4. This will give you access to types like Counter, Map, Set

## Requirements

- Import the `CompactStandardLibrary` module

## Verify

```bash
compactc exercise.compact
```

The Counter type declaration should work after the import.
