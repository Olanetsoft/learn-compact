# Getting Started

In this chapter, you'll set up everything needed to develop Compact smart contracts:

1. Install the Compact compiler
2. Set up the Lace wallet for testing
3. Get test tokens from the faucet
4. Configure Docker for the proof server
5. Install the VS Code extension
6. Write and compile your first contract

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a complete development environment and your first compiled Compact contract.

Let's get started!
